## WebSocket Message Format

### Text Mode Protocol (`/ws/interview`)

The text interview happens over a persistent WebSocket connection. Messages are exchanged as JSON objects with `type` and `data` fields.

### Client → Server Messages

#### `start` — Begin Interview
```json
{
  "type": "start",
  "data": {
    "role": "Software Engineer",
    "name": "Alice Chen"
  }
}
```

#### `message` — Send User Response
```json

{
  "type": "end",
  "data": {}
}
```

---

### Server → Client Messages

#### `chunk` — Streaming Response (Mid-Response)
Sent repeatedly as the AI generates its answer. Multiple chunks combine to form the complete response.
```json

    "done": false
  }
}
```
```json

    "content": "identified the time complexity.",
    "done": false
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "type": "chunk",
  "data": {
    "content": " Now let me ask the follow-up...",
    "done": true
  }
}
```

#### `response` — Full Response (Complete)
Sent after all chunks are delivered. Contains the full AI message (optional; frontend can reconstruct from chunks).
```json

    "status": "connected"
  }
}
```

### Voice Mode Protocol (`/ws/voice-interview`) — Full-Duplex Audio Streaming

The voice interview stream occurs over a WebSocket connection carrying **simultaneous bidirectional audio frames**, enabling full-duplex conversations where both user and AI can speak at the same time.

**Full-Duplex Audio Architecture**
- **Simultaneous audio streams:** User microphone → Server and Server → User speakers run concurrently
- **No turn-taking required:** Both parties can transmit and receive audio at the same time
- **Real-time bidirectional flow:** Audio frames flow in both directions without waiting for the other party to finish
- **Continuous monitoring:** Microphone remains open and actively listening throughout the session
- **Automatic speech detection:** The system detects user speech and AI speech without explicit signaling

**Audio Format**
- **Encoding:** PCM 16-bit mono or WebM format
- **Sample Rate:** 16 kHz (standard for speech recognition and synthesis)
- **Frame Duration:** 100–500ms chunks (variable depending on network latency)
- **Bidirectional:** Client and server send/receive audio simultaneously with minimal latency (~100-500ms total)

**Client ⇄ Server (Simultaneous Audio Exchange)**
```
User speaks → Microphone captures PCM frames → WebSocket sends to server
             (while simultaneously receiving...)
Server sends AI audio → Audio frames received → Speaker/headphones play back
```

Both streams are active at the same time, enabling natural, overlapping conversation just like a phone call.

**Binary WebSocket Frames**

**User Audio (Client → Server)**
```
Binary WebSocket frame containing PCM audio data from user's microphone
Frame structure: [audio_chunk_bytes]
Sent continuously while microphone is capturing speech
```

**AI Audio (Server → Client)**
```
Binary WebSocket frame containing synthesized audio from Gemini Live API
Frame structure: [audio_chunk_bytes]
Sent in real-time as the AI speaks, without waiting for user to finish
```

**Session Control (JSON over WebSocket)**

**Start Voice Interview**
```json
{
  "type": "start",
  "data": {
    "role": "Software Engineer",
    "candidate_name": "Alice Chen",
    "mode": "voice"
  }
}
```
Response: Server opens full-duplex audio channel and sends `session_ready` message.

**Session Ready (Server → Client)**
```json
{
  "type": "session_ready",
  "data": {
    "mode": "voice",
    "output_sample_rate": 24000
  }
}
```
Sent immediately after voice session is established. Browser should start mic capture after this message.

**End Voice Interview**
```json
{
  "type": "end",
  "data": {}
}
```
Response: Server closes audio streams and sends interview feedback (same format as text mode).

**Server → Client Control Messages**

**AI Turn Complete**
```json
{
  "type": "ai_turn_complete",
  "data": {}
}
```
Sent when the AI finishes speaking and is waiting for user input. Browser can use this to update UI state.

**AI Interrupted (Barge-In)**
```json
{
  "type": "ai_interrupted",
  "data": {}
}
```
Sent when the user interrupts the AI mid-response. Browser must immediately flush its audio playback queue.

**Transcripts**
```json
{
  "type": "transcript",
  "data": {
    "content": "That's a great answer...",
    "speaker": "ai",
    "final": true
  }
}
```
Optional transcript messages showing what the AI heard or said. `speaker` is either `"ai"` or `"user"`.

---

**Key Full-Duplex Behaviors**
1. **Continuous listening:** User microphone streams continuously from session start to end
2. **Simultaneous bidirectional audio:** Both send and receive happen at the same time via `asyncio.gather()` on the server
3. **Immediate playback:** Server streams AI audio as it arrives; no wait-for-turn gate
4. **Barge-in support:** User speech interrupts AI response via Gemini Live's built-in barge-in detection; server sends `ai_interrupted` signal
5. **Echo cancellation:** Browser-native echo cancellation (via Web Audio API `echoCancellation: true`) prevents mic feedback—no need for server-side mic muting
6. **No turn-signaling:** Gemini Live's voice activity detection (VAD) handles when to respond; no explicit `voice_start_speaking` / `voice_stop_speaking` messages needed

### High-Level Flow

```
Browser (Vanilla JS)
    ↓ WebSocket
FastAPI Backend
    ↓ HTTP
Google Gemini API
    ↓ Response Stream
FastAPI Backend
    ↓ WebSocket Chunks
Browser (Vanilla JS)
```

### Key Components

**`backend/main.py`**
- FastAPI application entry point
- Serves static files (SPA) from `/static` directory
- HTTP Routes:
  - `GET /` — Serves `index.html`
  - `GET /api/config/roles` — Returns available interview roles
  - `GET /api/health` — Health check endpoint
- WebSocket Endpoints:
  - `WS /ws/interview` — Text-based interview handler
  - `WS /ws/voice-interview` — Voice-based interview handler with full-duplex concurrent task model
    - Runs two independent `asyncio` tasks simultaneously using `asyncio.gather()`:
      - **Task A:** Receive binary audio from browser microphone → relay to Gemini Live
      - **Task B:** Receive audio/transcripts from Gemini Live → stream back to browser
    - Both tasks run concurrently, enabling true full-duplex bidirectional audio

**`backend/gemini_service.py`**
- `GeminiInterviewService` class — encapsulates a single text interview session
- `GeminiVoiceService` class — encapsulates a single full-duplex voice interview session via Gemini Live API
- Text Mode:
  - Manages conversation history for context awareness
  - Handles streaming responses from Gemini API
  - Methods: `start_session()`, `send_message()`, `end_session()`, `close()`
- Voice Mode:
  - Real-time bidirectional audio streaming via Gemini Live API (`gemini-2.0-flash-live-001`)
  - Built-in voice activity detection (VAD) and barge-in support
  - Methods: `connect()`, `send_audio()`, `receive()` (async generator), `close()`

**`static/index.html`**
- Single-page app shell with three screens:
  - **Setup Screen** — name input, role selector, interview mode selector (text or voice), start button
  - **Text Chat Screen** — message list, input bar, end button (for text interviews)
  - **Voice Controls Screen** — microphone status, recording indicator, playback control, end button (for voice interviews)

**`static/app.js`**
- WebSocket client for text interviews
- Voice audio capture and playback handlers
- Event handlers for user interactions
- UI state management (connecting, connected, disconnected, recording, playing)
- Message rendering (text: bubbles; voice: waveform indicators)

**`static/style.css`**
- Professional design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Responsive layout with flexbox
- Dark header, light content area
- Smooth animations for transitions

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**`.env.example`** template:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Required:**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

**Optional:**
- `PYTHONENV` — Set to `production` for production deployments (defaults to development)

### Supported Interview Roles

```python
ROLES = [
    "Software Engineer",
    "Data Scientist",
    "Product Manager",
    "System Design",
]
```

Each role triggers a different system prompt tuned to that position's typical interview questions and skills.

## Troubleshooting

### Text Interview Issues

#### Issue: `GEMINI_API_KEY is not configured`

**Cause:** The `.env` file doesn't exist or the key wasn't added.

**Fix:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your actual API key
```

#### Issue: WebSocket connection fails or drops

**Cause:** Network issue, server crash, or API rate limit.

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Verify your API key is valid at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
3. Restart the server: `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`
4. Try a fresh interview session

#### Issue: Responses are very slow or don't appear

**Cause:** Network latency, Gemini API rate limiting, or server overload.

**Fix:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try again in a few minutes (if rate limited)
3. Check the browser console for network errors
4. Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid

#### Issue: Tests fail with import errors

**Cause:** Dependencies not installed.

**Fix:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Voice Interview Issues

#### Issue: "Microphone permission denied"

**Cause:** The browser requires explicit permission to access your microphone, and you clicked "Deny" or your device doesn't have a mic.

**Fix:**
1. Check that your device has a working microphone
2. In your browser settings, allow the site permission to access the microphone:
   - **Chrome/Edge:** Settings → Privacy → Site Permissions → Microphone → Allow [your-site.com]
   - **Firefox:** Preferences → Privacy & Security → Permissions → Microphone → Allow this site
   - **Safari:** System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Microphone → Allow your-browser
3. Reload the page and try again

#### Issue: Microphone works but no audio output

**Cause:** Audio output is muted or speakers/headphones aren't connected.

**Fix:**
1. Check that your speakers or headphones are connected
2. Verify system volume is not muted
3. Check browser volume (some browsers have independent volume controls)
4. Test audio output on another website (e.g., YouTube)

#### Issue: Voice interview cuts out or has poor quality

**Cause:** Unstable network connection or high latency.

**Fix:**
1. Check your internet connection speed (use speedtest.net)
2. Move closer to your router or use a wired connection
3. Close other bandwidth-heavy applications (downloads, streaming)
4. Try again during a less congested time of day

#### Issue: The AI doesn't respond to my voice

**Cause:** Microphone isn't capturing audio, or background noise is too loud.

**Fix:**
1. Test microphone on another site (e.g., voice call service)
2. Reduce background noise (close windows, turn off fans, find a quiet space)
3. Speak clearly and at a normal volume
4. Check that the browser's audio recording indicator shows recording is active

#### Issue: Voice mode not available (greyed out button)

**Cause:** Your browser doesn't support Web Audio API, or the microphone isn't working properly.

**Fix:**
1. Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox 55+, Safari 14.1+)
2. Check that you're on the latest version
3. Ensure your browser is up to date and try refreshing the page

## Performance Notes

- **First message latency:** 1–3 seconds (API connection + model load)
- **Streaming chunks:** ~100–300ms per chunk (depends on network & Gemini response time)
- **Session duration:** 5–15 minutes typical; can be shorter or longer
- **Concurrent users:** Designed for single-user interviews; each connection gets its own service instance

---

## Security

⚠️ **Never commit `.env` with your actual API key!**

- `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`
- Always use `.env.example` as a template
- Rotate your API key if it's accidentally committed

### Best Practices

1. Keep your `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret
